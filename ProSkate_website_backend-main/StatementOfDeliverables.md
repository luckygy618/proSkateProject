# Statement of Deliverables
The Statement of Deliverables lists the final deliverables which will be completed by the end of the project. To determine these deliverables, we are first listing the task types involved with the project, all nouns which are associated with the system, then picking out any required Angular services and components based on those nouns, then picking out any required database models based on those nouns, and finally compiling these lists into a list of tangible deliverables based on the type of work required for each service, component or model in the project.

The final list of deliverables will then be converted into the Statement of Scope, which will divide scope of work for each deliverable between each group member and specify which responsibilities are not being included in the scope of this project and are either being left for future projects or for the client to manage.

The final list of deliverables will also be converted into a budget which will attribute a specific number of hours to each group member for each deliverable and based on an hourly rate will calculate the proposed price for the project.
