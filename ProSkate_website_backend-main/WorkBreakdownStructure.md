# Work Breakdown Structure

## About This Document
The Work Breakdown Structure is a timeline of the type of work that needs to be completed in each phase and the start and end dates of that phase. At the end of each phase, we should have a milestone which we can show to the client or teacher to get feedback on it. After getting feedback we can then apply that feedback to the work to be completed in the next phase.

## Phase 1 [Start: June 28 - End: July 31]
Phase 1 will be used to do research into the needs of the client on the front-end and various front-end technologies such as TypeScript and Angular, to test those technologies and to start to create a rough prototype of the front-end of the project. The following is a list of the types of work which we will be doing in this phase.

1. Research, Benchmarking and Analysis
2. User Interface Design
3. HTML Coding
4. CSS and Sass Programming
5. TypeScript and Angular Programming


## Phase 2 [Start: August 1 - End: September 3]
Phase 2 will continue the research and prototyping from Phase 1 but will add research, testing and prototyping of back-end technologies such as Node or Python into the work. The following is a list of the types of work which we will be doing in this phase.

1. Research, Benchmarking and Analysis
2. User Interface Design
3. HTML Coding
4. CSS and Sass Programming
5. TypeScript and Angular Programming
6. Database Setup
7. Node.js and Express Programming
8. Python and Django Programming



## Client requirements: UI
It is okay to copy the working structure, however, the client does want to improve UX. Basically the path from going on the website to making an order has to be as easy as possible. We should look into other online stores and take note of their structure.

As an extra, he also requested filtering options for search that match specific parameters such as: Skating style, durability, comfort, etc. which describe inline skates.

## Client requirements: Deadlines
A client requested us to make a planned out list of features, divided into stages. Per completion of a stage, we get paid for that part.
A deadline proposed by the client was Alpha in December, Beta later, release in February. 

## Client requirements: Price
We gotta figure out how much we want to get paid.


Concrete tasks:
Start an Angular project, start naming, planning and setting up components we will need.

Why? So that we can branch out into many other tasks once this one is done.
